# FastDischarge

A text editor designed for facilitation of faster discharge summaries and medical documentation, similar to EPIC's Smart Text. Written in Slate.js/Typescript. STILL A WORK IN PROGRESS!

Features on the roadmap:
- [ ] Tab-through fields for template elements in the document with suggestions of elements to select from.
- [ ] Ability to export rich text and plain text (as Markdown).

Down-the-line features that won't be implemented unless hospitals pay me for it:
- [ ] Direct eMR integration/using API calls to set values for template fields
