# FastDischarge
![FastDischarge logo](./public/logo192.png)

A text editor designed for facilitation of faster discharge summaries and medical documentation, similar to EPIC's Smart Text. Written with Slate/React/Typescript.

Currently usable but there are a few fairly major bugs with display, cosmetics, general function, etc. that I'm still trying to fix. This is very much still a work in progress!

I do plan on developing eMR integration at a later stage but there are probably going to be legal headaches involved...
