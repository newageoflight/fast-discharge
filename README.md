# FastDischarge
![FastDischarge logo](./public/logo192.png)

A text editor designed for facilitation of faster discharge summaries and medical documentation, similar to EPIC's Smart Text. Written in Slate.js/Typescript.

Currently usable but there are a few fairly major bugs with display, cosmetics, general function, etc. that I'm still trying to fix. This is very much still a work in progress!
